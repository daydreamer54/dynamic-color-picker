What we need to have for such a result;

# Packages;
  
 1 - We will use **flutter_material_color_picker** package to have such a color palette<br>
 2 - We will use **provider** package when a color picked from color dialog to listen to the changes<br>
 3 - We will use **shared_preferences** package to save when a color picked with that way when you close you application color value will be saved into your device<br>

# don't forget to import those packages into pubspec.yaml file.

# I've left necessary comments in the files to understand how it works
